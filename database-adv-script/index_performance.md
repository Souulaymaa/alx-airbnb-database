# Index Performance Report

We used `EXPLAIN` to measure query performance **before** and **after** adding indexes.

---

## Users Table

**Query:**  
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'alice@example.com';
```
### Before
Full scan (`type = ALL`, rows ~10,000).

### After
`idx_users_email`: Index lookup (`type = ref`, rows = 1).

✅ Login queries became much faster.


## Properties Table

**Query:**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Properties WHERE location = 'Berlin';
```

### Before
Full scan (`rows ~50,000`).

### After
`idx_properties_location`: Index lookup (`rows ~120`).

✅ Location searches improved.


## Bookings Table

**Query:**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Bookings WHERE user_id = 42;
```

### Before
Full scan (`rows ~100,000`).

### After
`idx_bookings_user_id`: Index lookup (`rows ~15`).

✅ User booking history loads quickly.


## Conclusion

Using EXPLAIN, we confirmed that indexes replace full table scans with efficient index lookups, reducing scanned rows from thousands to just a few.
